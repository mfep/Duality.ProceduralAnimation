# Duality.ProceduralAnimation
## Overview
The ProceduralAnimation plugin is a Core Plugin for the [Duality2D](http://duality.adamslair.net/) open source game engine.
It helps to create complex behaviours, mainly on the field of gameObject movement, however other usages are possible too.
The *procedural* word in the name refers to the functional nature of this toolkit:
behaviours (movement) is controlled by mathematical functions.

This means, that unlike most animation tools, there are no keyframes or similar traditional animation methods here.
Despite it may feel intimidating at first, it enables quick iteration over animation sequences,
which are difficult to achieve using the keyframe technique.

'Real-world' examples include (these examples are not added to the repo yet):
* Camera/Screenshake.
* Movement in a tile-based game.
* Weapon swinging / recoil
* ...
